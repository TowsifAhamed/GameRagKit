# GameRAGKit — Commercial Licensing

This repository is dual-licensed:

- **Community (non-commercial) use** is under **PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** (see `LICENSE.md`).
- **Commercial use** requires a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

## How to get a commercial license

Please include:
- Your product/company name
- How you plan to use GameRAGKit (internal, shipped game, SaaS, tools, etc.)
- Any distribution details (stores/platforms) if applicable

## Our intent

We keep commercial licensing lightweight — we’re not chasing big sums. We mainly want clear recognition that your
product uses GameRAGKit (e.g., attribution in credits/docs and/or a note in your OSS/compliance page).
