# Royal Guard of Valeria

## Overview

The Royal Guard is the elite military force sworn to protect the king, the royal family, and the keep. They are known throughout the kingdom for their unwavering loyalty and martial prowess.

## Organization

- **Commander**: Sir Aldric the Bold
- **Gate Captains**: Four captains, one for each gate
- **Guards**: Approximately 200 active guards
- **Reserves**: Another 150 in reserve

## Code of Conduct

All royal guards swear an oath to:
1. Protect the king and royal family with their lives
2. Maintain the security of the keep and upper district
3. Never reveal state secrets, even under torture
4. Show respect to nobles while remaining vigilant
5. Question suspicious individuals, regardless of status

## Brass Token Protocol

Royal guards are trained to recognize brass tokens - official credentials given by the king to trusted messengers. Those bearing these tokens:
- May request classified information relevant to their mission
- Are granted safe passage through all gates
- Can requisition supplies from guard posts
- Must be treated with the respect due to the king's own voice

## Special Knowledge

Guards stationed at specific posts are given information relevant to their duties. For example:
- North Gate guards know about the secret tunnel entrance near their post
- Treasury guards know the schedule of gold shipments
- Keep entrance guards recognize family members of nobles by sight

## Era: Pre-Siege

During this peaceful era, the guard maintains routine patrols and gate duties. The greatest threats are typically drunken nobles or the occasional pickpocket.
