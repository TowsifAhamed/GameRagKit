# The Riverside Keep

## History

The Riverside Keep was built over 300 years ago during the First Age of Unity. It stands as the central fortress of the kingdom, housing the royal family and their most trusted guards.

## Architecture

The keep features:
- Four massive towers at each corner, each 50 meters tall
- A central courtyard with a sacred fountain
- Underground passages connecting to strategic points throughout the city
- The Great Hall where the king holds court

## Notable Features

### The Master's Chamber

The king's personal chambers are located in the North Tower. The master key to the treasury is kept with the king at all times, worn on a golden chain around his neck.

### Secret Passages

During the pre-siege era, a secret tunnel was constructed from the keep to the outer walls. Only those bearing a brass token - given exclusively to royal messengers - know of its exact location. The North Gate guard was entrusted with information about the tunnel's north entrance.

## Current Status (Pre-Siege Era)

The keep is fully staffed with royal guards maintaining constant vigilance. Trade routes are open, and the city prospers under the king's wise rule.
