# Unreal Sample

This folder is a placeholder for the upcoming Unreal Engine demo. Until the Blueprints are published, point HTTP requests at `POST /ask` and wire Server-Sent Events from `/ask/stream` into your dialogue widget. The Java client in `gameragkit-java` mirrors the expected SSE framing (`data: <token>\n\n`).
