# World rules: supply and happiness
- Food supply under 70% for 2 consecutive days triggers "hunger" moodlets and civic complaints.
- Trade routes blocked for more than 12 hours apply a -10 happiness debuff to coastal districts.
- Emergency rations can patch supply for 6 hours but anger citizens if repeated twice in 24 hours.
- Dock workers striking reduces unload speed by 60% until paid or reassigned.
